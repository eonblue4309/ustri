    <h2>Michigan Honbu Dojo - East Lansing, Michigan</h2>
    <p>
      The Michiagan Honbu dojo is the headquarters for Tamiya Ryu Iajiutsu
      operations in the United States. Surrounded by a beautiful Japanese
      garden, this traditional dojo was built from plans based on a traditional
      Japanese training hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      All classes are by assignment and are held weekly throughout the year with
      the exception of a winter weather break - The dojo is unheated and
      Michigan winters are harsh!
    </p>
    <p>
      Special classes or changes to this schedule will be discussed in the
      respective classes. Please note, if there are 5 weeks in a given month,
      there will be no classes during the fifth week.
