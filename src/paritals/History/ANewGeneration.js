    <h3>A New Generation</h3>
    <p>
      In January of 2008, the Executive Branch of the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu
      Genwakai embarked upon one of its most significant projects to date.
      Genwakai President Tsumaki Soshi, Vice President Abe, Operations Director
      Sugizaki and Soshi Assistant Endo began a task which Soshi Sensei
      describes as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "The Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai has made a plan to standardize the
      techniques of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu for transmission to future generations."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      For six months, this group reviewed notes written by 14th Soke Tsumaki
      Seirin Genshin and developed a set of standardized procedures for the
      performance of both Reishiki (Etiquette) and the 11 Kata that comprise the
      Omote no Maki, or First Volume, of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu techniques and
      formally introduced them to the Japanese Branches on June 22 of 2008.
      These Standardized Techniques, or "Touitsu Jikou", were introduced in
      lecture format to the US Branches at their Closing Class on June 28, 2008
      and in full practice format at their Fall All-Member Practice Session on
      September 6, 2008. Since that time, the members of USTRI have been
      learning to incorporate these Standardized Techniques into their regular
      practice of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu under the guidance of their Shidosha, or
      Instructors.

      On November 24, 2008 an 11 member delegation, including Alexanian Shihan,
      attended their first Genwakai Taikai in Japan. Six USTRI Deshi in the
      Delegation took their Shinsa (Examinations) in the morning and, at Soshi
      Sensei's request, the USTRI Delegation performed their Inaugural Enbu
      (formal demonstration) during the Taikai afternoon program. Following the
      Taikai there was a social gathering at a traditional Japanese restaurant
      for all Taikai participants. Prior to attending the Genwakai Taikai, the
      delegation stayed in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture and spent about 5 days
      visiting various points of interest such as the Grand Shrine at Ise, Mt.
      Hiei and Enryakuji Temple, famous castles of Shiga and notable temples of
      Kyoto, etc. The Delegation returned to the United States on November 26
      (Please refer to the Student Views section of this website for some of the
      trip participant's impressions of their time spent in Japan).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on March 29, 2009, following the Shidosha, Kodansha and Honbucho
      Lecture in Yokosuka, Japan, a meeting of the Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai
      Board of Directors (Rijikai) was held. With Vice President Abe acting as
      the leader, there was a discussion concerning the succession of Tsumaki
      Kazuo Genwa Soshi to 15th Soke of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. With very strong
      support from the Executives (Kanbu) and Directors (Riji) of the Genwakai,
      the result after deliberations was that he should indeed succeed to the
      position of 15th Soke of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, as a result of the recent unfortunate economic downturn that has
      deeply affected both America and Japan, a joint decision was made in 2009
      between 15th Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei and the USTRI Board of
      Directors that the 2009 visit to Michigan by Soke Sensei and his
      Assistant, Endo Tsuyako (Gentei) Sensei, as well as the 2010 USTRI trip to
      Japan should be postponed until the economic climate improves. If all goes
      well, the regular schedule of exchanges will resume in 2011 when Soke
      Sensei and Endo Sensei visit Michigan and the USTRI Delegation attends the
      Genwakai Taikai in Japan in 2012.
