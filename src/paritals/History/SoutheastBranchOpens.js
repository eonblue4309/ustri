    <h3>Southeast Michigan Branch Opens</h3>
    <p>
      The year 2004 saw the beginning of the expansion of the United States
      Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu organization with the establishment of its first
      formal Study Group in Clarkston, Michigan under the leadership of Brent
      Eastman Sensei (Tamiya Ryu Sandan). Through an arrangement with the
      Clarkston Parks and Recreation Department, Eastman Sensei was able to
      arrange for a superb training facility and the opportunity for those in
      the eastern side of the state to study Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu became
      possible.

      2004 also saw the temporary suspension of all Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Taikai
      (conventions) and Shinsa (formal testing) due to the advanced age of Soke
      Sensei, who found that he was no longer able to attend these events due to
      a decline in his mobility, hearing and eyesight. Group training sessions
      supervised by Fuku Soke continued in anticipation of the day when the
      Taikai and Shinsa would resume once again.

      In the summer of 2005, Fuku Soke Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei, accompanied
      by his Assistant, Endo Tsuyako Gentei Sensei, returned once again to East
      Lansing, Michigan. During this 2005 visit, he conducted various training
      sessions for USTRI Deshi of all levels, as well as led an Open Seminar for
      the general public introducing the basic elements of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu.
      On Thursday, July 14, Fuku Soke presided over the 3rd Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu
      Michigan Taikai, conducting group training classes in the morning and
      supervising the formal testing for rank in the afternoon. Following the
      formal testing (Shinsa), Fuku Soke issued promotion certificates to those
      who passed their examinations. This year's group of Shinsa Candidates was
      the biggest yet, with twenty-four Deshi testing for ranks ranging from
      Ikkyu through Nanadan.

      The next day, the Sensei traveled to Guelph, Ontario, Canada to
      participate as Instructors at the annual Guelph School of Japanese Sword
      Arts, held every third weekend of July. The trip to Canada concluded with
      the Sensei visiting Niagara Falls, accompanied by driver Ken Young (Tamiya
      Ryu Iaijutsu Sandan) and Michael Alexanian (Gennan) Shihan.

      Also during this visit, the decision was made to upgrade the status of the
      Clarkston Study Group to that of an official Branch (Shibu), with Brent
      Eastman Sensei being promoted to Branch Manager (Shibucho). Enrollment in
      the Clarkston Branch (now known as the Southeast Michigan Branch)
      continued to increase and a very cohesive group began to develop.
