    <h3>Passing of a Generation</h3>
    <p>
      In May of 2006 a contingent of 8 USTRI members, along with Alexanian
      Shihan and Karwowski Sensei, traveled to Japan for the purpose of
      researching the "roots" of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. They went first to
      Wakayama City, where the line known as Kishu Tamiya Ryu originated, and
      had an opportunity to tour Wakayama Castle as well as enjoy a joint
      training session with the Tamiya Ryu Wakayama Branch. The group then
      proceeded on to Iyo-Saijo on the island of Shikoku where Matsudaira
      Yorizumi, the second son of Kishu Dainagon Yorinobu, introduced Tamiya Ryu
      to the area. Iyo-Saijo is also where the Tsumaki family eventually
      inherited Tamiya Ryu and where the family cemetery of the Tsumaki family
      is located. Following a formal demonstration of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu by
      Alexanian Shihan and Karwowski Sensei at the Saijo Shrine, the entire
      group made a special stop at the Tsumaki family cemetery to pay their
      respects and present fresh flowers in memory of the Tsumaki clan. Other
      places of significance to the history of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu that the
      group visited were Himeiji Castle, Seki City in Gifu prefecture for a
      demonstration of traditional Japanese sword-making and various places in
      the old capital of Kyoto.

      When 2007 arrived, significant changes occurred that would impact not only
      USTRI, but the entire organization as well. At the beginning of June,
      while in the midst of making plans for the bi-annual visit from Fuku Soke
      and Endo Sensei, the USTRI Michigan Honbu Dojo received word from Fuku
      Soke that his father, Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu 14th Soke Tsumaki Seirin, had
      gone to his eternal sleep at the age of 102 years old. The decision was
      then made to make the 2007 Tamiya Ryu Michigan Taikai a Memorial Taikai in
      Soke's honor. The Taikai was a great success and many special activities
      were conducted in memory of Soke Sensei. There was a silent prayer for
      Soke Sensei at the beginning of the Taikai, as well as a memorial video
      presentation showcasing Soke Sensei in his later years. All those in
      attendance received a copy of the memorial video as a way of having
      something of Soke Sensei that they could keep with them forever. Another
      important change during the summer of 2007 was the introduction of the
      Kenshibu (traditional Japanese dance with sword and fan) component of
      Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu to the USTRI curriculum. During their stay in
      Michigan, Fuku Soke and Endo Sensei introduced the Kenshibu piece
      Kawanakajima to the members of USTRI during a special seminar held during
      the Taikai. Kenshibu has now become an integral part of the USTRI monthly
      training schedule, with the last class of each month being devoted to
      becoming more proficient in the movements of this particular piece.On
      Saturday, September 22, 2007, a meeting was held at the Citizens Hall in
      Fujisawa City, Japan, to decide the future of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu in the
      wake of Soke Sensei's passing. It was at that time that Fuku Soke Tsumaki
      Sensei was unanimously declared as Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu 15th Headmaster
      (Soshi) and President (Kaicho) of the new organization known as the Tamiya
      Ryu Iaijutsu Genwakai. With that decided formal Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Taikai
      and Shinsa resumed in Japan once again on November 23, 2007 under the
      auspices of the Genwakai.
