    <h2>United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu</h2>
    <p>
      Training focuses on the harmonization of mind, body, and spirit through
      the practice and performance of kata (pre-arranged techniques). Techniques
      are practiced with the philosophy of the "sword which gives life (Katsujin
      no Ken)," as opposed to the "sword which takes life (Satsujin no Ken)."
    </p>
    <p>
      Emphasis is placed on basic techniques. To properly learn kata means
      studying 1) how to cut using the scabbard opening (sayaguchi) and 2) how
      to use the scabbard hand (sayate).

      Occasionally students will also practice Kenshibu - a traditional Japanese
      dance utilizing sword and fan. Kenshibu is performed to the accompaniment
      of poems (sung in a style called Shigin) that depict famous events in
      Japanese history.
