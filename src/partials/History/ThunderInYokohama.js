    <h3>Thunder in Yokohama</h3>
    <p>
      The history of the United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization begins
      in August of 1993 when Dianne and Michael Alexanian of East Lansing,
      Michigan made their first trip to Japan as delegates of the Michigan-Shiga
      Goodwill Mission Cultural Exchange. During that trip, they traveled to
      Yokohama, Japan and met the Goto family, who were good friends with
      Tsumaki Kazuo Genwa Sensei, the son of the current and 14th Headmaster of
      Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu, Tsumaki Seirin Genshin Soke. At a special training
      session arranged by Mr. And Mrs. Goto, the Alexanians met Tsumaki Sensei
      for the first time and had an opportunity to be introduced to the art of
      Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu, as well as demonstrate for Tsumaki Sensei a bit of
      the sword art they had been studying since 1987 (Toyama Ryu Iaido.) Note:
      For a more detailed description of this first meeting with Tsumaki Sensei,
      please refer to the article "Thunder in Yokohama", found in the Articles
      Section of this website.

      In 1994, after the death of Michael's father, the Alexanians returned to
      Japan to seek inner peace and a new direction for their lives. During that
      time, with Mrs. Goto acting as their interpreter, they petitioned Tsumaki
      Sensei to become Deshi (formal students) of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. After
      consulting with his father, Tsumaki Sensei agreed to accept the Alexanians
      as the first American Deshi of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu and their training
      began in earnest.

      After two years of diligent training on his own under the guidance of
      Tsumaki Sensei, Michael Alexanian took his first examination for rank in
      Japan in the Fall of 1995. It was at that time that Soke Sensei awarded
      him the combined ranks of Shodan (First Degree) and Nidan (Second Degree).
      Soke Sensei also took into careful consideration Michael's previous seven
      years of training in Iaido when making this decision. In the Spring of
      1996, after successfully completing the formal examination requirements
      for the rank of Sandan (Third Degree), Michael Alexanian was given a
      written commission by Soke Sensei to introduce the art of Tamiya Ryu
      Iaijutsu to North America for the first time in the history of the Ryuha
      (School). In September of 1996, on the occasion of the formal opening
      ceremonies for the Shakunage Cultural Center and Japanese Gardens, built
      on the grounds of the Alexanian's home in East Lansing, Michigan, Tsumaki
      Sensei came to Michigan for the first time to participate in the
      ceremonies and dedicate the Culture Center as the very first Dojo for
      Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu in North America.

      Since that time, Tsumaki Sensei has traveled to Michigan numerous times to
      conduct formal training and testing for Deshi of the United States Tamiya
      Ryu Iaijutsu Organization and to get to know them better on both a
      professional and personal level. In July of 1998, both Soke Sensei and
      Tsumaki Sensei came to Michigan to conduct seminars, formal training and
      testing for Deshi of Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu. Quite an accomplishment for Soke
      Sensei as he was 93 at that time! In 1999, 2002 and 2004, Deshi of the
      United States Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Organization journeyed to Odawara, Japan
      to participate in the All-Japan Tamiya Ryu Iaijutsu Koshukai and Shinsakai
      (Lecture and Testing Event) held every Spring and Fall.
